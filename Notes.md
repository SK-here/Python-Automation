# Definations & Notes

## Purpose

### File Descriptor

    A token generated by the OS, that allows program to do more operations
    with the files.

    In Python this is stored as a attribute of a file object. And with the file 
    object we can use methods to operate on a file.

    e.g. Read, Write, Delete, Modify Text, etc.

In python before performing any operation on the file first we need to open it.

```python
# Opening the file
file = file.open("/paht/to/file/FileName.extension")
```

To read the line

```python
# Reading a single line
file.readline()
```

or

```python
# Reading a single line
file.read()
```

Above code reads the entire file but starting from current position to EOF.
